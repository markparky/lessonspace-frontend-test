### Overview:
Your task is to create a component that allows you to select a value. The values in this case will be an ID representing a product. The component should have a built-in fuzzy search that you can use to search for products from an API and then select one of the results to become the value of the component.

### Specification:
- Set up a new JavaScript app in this folder. You can use whichever package manager you like - npm, yarn, pnpm etc. and the folder structure is up to you!
- The design for this component is in this Figma file: [https://www.figma.com/file/pxAYB47dGVQjfnokl1J9fA/Fuzzy-Search](https://www.figma.com/file/pxAYB47dGVQjfnokl1J9fA/Fuzzy-Search) (the password is "lessonspace‚Äù). You should match the design as accurately as possible. If there are aspects or states missing from the design that you want to add, feel free to add them in. 
- The component will need to fetch search results from an API as you type. You can use this dummy endpoint for the data: [https://dummyjson.com/products](https://dummyjson.com/products) (searches can be queried like so [https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=Laptop](https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=Laptop))
- The rest is up to you! We‚Äôre looking to see your approach to building a piece of functionality that a user will be interacting with and how you might make that experience as pleasant and productive as possible, so do as much as you feel necessary to make that happen.
- When you're done, you can commit your results to a repo and send to us for review.

### Guidelines:
- You can use TypeScript or JavaScript, although there will be bonus points for TypeScript if you are comfortable using it (if not, this is a great opportunity to start learning üòÑ)
- You can use any framework (React, Svelte, etc.), or plain Vanilla JS, but we would prefer to see Vue as that‚Äôs what our codebase uses.
- You can use any CSS framework/preprocessors you like (or handwrite your own) but remember to match the design as closely as possible.
- You may use additional packages and libraries along the way if you feel it‚Äôll be more productive, but remember to keep performance and load times in mind.
- The task should take you around 2 to 3 hours. Feel free to spend more or less time on it if you want, but don‚Äôt spend more than 4 hours if possible.
